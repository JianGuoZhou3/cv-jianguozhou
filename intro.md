PhD student of Bioinformatics at [Xue-Song Liu lab](https://github.com/XSLiuLab), [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), currently working on cancer genomics and immunotherapy biomarker by biostatistic skills.
I am a fan of R (particularly), Python and Golang. I love open source and open science.
I have developed many R package and shared much experience about coding and data analysis on many platforms.

For some details,

- I have advanced experience in using R and Shell for data preprocessing, data cleaning and data interpretation.
- I have moderate experience in using R for statistical modeling and data visualization.
- I master developing pure R packages and have a little experience in Python package, R Shiny and Rcpp development.
- I can combine multiple programming languages/tools to create analysis pipeline. I know how to use Docker to package analysis environment and enhance reproducible research.
- I can process raw genomic data and analyze them. I have moderate experience in somatic variant calling (including SNV, INDEL and CNV), differential expression analysis and enrichment analysis.
- I know how to do machine learning (including deep learning) and have applied some technologies to my projects.
- I like to write with R Markdown (including Markdown) and share my knowledge to others in many ways.
- I love to contribute open-source scientific tool development (e.g. [maftools](https://github.com/PoisonAlien/maftools), [forestmodel](https://github.com/NikNakk/forestmodel/)).
- Last not but least, I enjoy learning and researching.
